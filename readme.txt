Bridgy Publish Support for your Site

== Description == 

People often post something on their web site, then post a copy elsewhere so that other people will see it. The IndieWeb community calls this POSSE.

[Bridgy Publish](https://www.brid.gy/about#publishing) adds a hidden link to your post, and sends a webmention to Bridgy, which will create a post on the appropriate site. It also stores the link for display by Syndication Links. 

The plugin requires the [webmention](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/) plugin and will not
work without it.

== Changelog == 

= Version 1.0.0 =
	* Initial release
	* Takes over Syndication Links storage of Bridgy Publish links
